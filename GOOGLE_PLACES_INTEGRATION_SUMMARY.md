# Google Places Integration Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully integrated Google Places Autocomplete into the property location input field in the BrickSure insurance quote form.

## Files Created

1. **`src/components/UI/GooglePlacesInput.tsx`**
   - React component wrapping Google Places Autocomplete
   - Provides automatic address suggestions
   - Falls back to regular input if API key is not configured
   - Restricted to Nigeria (country code: "ng")

2. **`GOOGLE_PLACES_SETUP.md`**
   - Complete setup guide for Google Maps API
   - Instructions for obtaining and configuring API key
   - Troubleshooting tips
   - Cost considerations

## Files Modified

1. **`package.json`**
   - Added dependency: `@react-google-maps/api`

2. **`src/pages/Dashboard/GetQuote2.tsx`**
   - Imported `GooglePlacesInput` component
   - Updated property location input to use Google Places
   - Conditional rendering: uses GooglePlacesInput for property location, regular Input for other fields

3. **`.env.example`**
   - Added `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` environment variable placeholder

## How It Works

1. When users reach the "Enter Property Location" question in the quote form
2. They see an autocomplete input powered by Google Places
3. As they type, Google suggests addresses in Nigeria
4. Users can select from suggestions or type manually
5. The selected address is stored in the quiz state
6. Place details (coordinates, components) are logged for potential future use

## Setup Required

1. Get a Google Maps API key from Google Cloud Console
2. Enable Maps JavaScript API and Places API
3. Add the API key to your `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
4. Restart the development server

## Features

- ✅ Address autocomplete for Nigerian addresses
- ✅ Real-time suggestions as user types
- ✅ Automatic fallback to regular input if API unavailable
- ✅ Place details capture (coordinates, formatted address)
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing form flow
- ✅ No changes required to premium calculation logic

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. Set up your Google Maps API key (see GOOGLE_PLACES_SETUP.md)
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to Dashboard > Get Quote
4. Progress through the quiz until you reach "Enter Property Location"
5. Start typing an address (e.g., "Victoria Island Lagos")
6. Verify that autocomplete suggestions appear
7. Select an address and verify it's saved correctly

## Fallback Behavior

If no API key is configured or if the API fails:
- Component automatically falls back to a regular text input
- Users can still enter addresses manually
- Form functionality is not affected
- Warning logged to console for developers

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Extract Location Data**: Use place details to auto-fill state/LGA fields
2. **Geocoding**: Store coordinates for risk assessment (flood zones, etc.)
3. **Validation**: Verify address is within Nigeria
4. **Map Preview**: Show selected location on a map
5. **Address Components**: Parse street, city, postal code automatically
